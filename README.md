Budget Master is a Full-Stack application built with Next.js, TypeScript and MongoDB. The main goal of this project is to provide a nice and easy to read interface for the users about their income and expenses. The app provides a history of all executed transactions, charts of monthly spendings. The transactions can be filtered through, date or price range, and even with user defined labels for easier identification of payment types.
